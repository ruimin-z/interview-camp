# 1. Introduce and differentiate TCP/IP model and OSI model

OSI stands for open system interconnect model with 7 layers. Though OSI is very detailed standard in theory, TCP/IP with 4 layers is more applicable in reality. 

Each layer has its own functionality. Each layer is build upon lower layers, and provide service for upper layers.

The 7 layers for OSI model from top to bottom are: Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, and Physical layers.

The 4 layers for TCP/IP model from top to bottoms are: Application, Transport, Network and Link Layer.

- Application layer aim to provide **payload** to and from applications. Supported protocols include HTTP for web browsing, SFTP for file transferring, SMTP for emailing.
- Transport layer ensures end-to-end data transfer. The protocols include TCP that offers connection-oriented, reliable data delivery that ensures data completeness and accuracy, and UDP for fast, connectionless transmissions between hosts. 
- Network layer contains IP protocols which uses IP addresses to identify networks and hosts, and performs logical addressing to enable communication of **packets** across different networks.
- Link layer is in charge of the transportation of **frames**. It is responsible for physical media transportation in bit stream such as Ethernet or Wifi, with error detection and error correction, and also provides MAC address management via ARP.

## OSI
Open System Interconnect(OSI) model was created by International Organization for Standardization(ISO). 
The OSI networking model consists of seven layers. Each layer has its own functionality. Each layer is build upon the lower layer, and providing functions for upper layers.

The seven layers, from top to bottom, are: Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, and Physical layers.

| **Layer**                | **Unit of Data**              | **What it does**                                 | **What it contains**                           |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Link Layer               | Frame                         | Transfers raw data over physical/wireless link   | MAC addresses + Encapsulated Packet            |
| Internet (Network) Layer | Packet                        | Routes data across networks (IP addressing)      | IP header + Encapsulated Segment               |
| Transport Layer          | Segment (TCP) / Datagram (UDP) | Ensures reliable (or fast) delivery between applications | Port numbers + Encapsulated Data         |
| Application Layer        | Payload                 | Provides data to and from applications           | Actual content: emails, web pages, files       |


1. Application layer - payload

The application layer is the top layer and provides applications with standardized data exchange, giving access for applications to the network.
Its protocols include HTTP(for web browsing), FTP(for file transfer), Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3), SMTP(for email), DNS, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol and SNMP. 
At the application layer, the **payload** is the actual application data.


2. Transport layer - segment/datagram

The transport layer is responsible for maintaining end-to-end communications across the network. 
The transport protocols include TCP and UDP, which is sometimes used instead of TCP for special purposes.


> Differences between TCP/UDP?
> 
> - TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is connection-oriented, reliable, ensures data arrives in order, and performs error-checking and flow control. It’s used for things like web browsing, email, and file transfers.
> - UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is connectionless, faster but less reliable, with no guarantee of delivery, order, or duplicate protection. It’s used for real-time applications like video streaming, online gaming, and VoIP.


3. Internet layer / Network layer - packets

This layer deals with **packets** and connects independent networks to transport the packets across **network boundaries**. 
This layer determines the best route the data should take from source to destination and handles **logical addressing** via IP addresses.
The network layer protocols are **IP** and **Internet Control Message Protocol(ICMP)**, which are used for error reporting.

A socket is a combination of an IP address and a port number.

4. Network Access layer/ Network Interface Layer/ Data link layer - **Frame**

This layer consists of protocols that operate only on a **link** -- the network component that interconnects nodes or 
hosts in the network. 
The protocols in this lowest layer include 
- **Ethernet** for **local area networks(LAN)** 
- Wifi for wireless local area networks (WLAN)
- Address Resolution Protocol(ARP) which maps IP addresses to MAC addresses.


> How does the Network Interface Layer manages hardware addresses (MAC addresses)? 
1. Maintains the Device’s Own MAC Address:
Each network interface (Ethernet card or Wi-Fi adapter) is assigned a unique MAC address at the factory. When sending frames, the Network Interface Layer includes this source MAC address in the frame header.

2. Encapsulates Data into Frames:
Before data travels over Ethernet or Wi-Fi, the Network Interface Layer encapsulates it in frames, adding:
Destination MAC address, Source MAC address, Payload (the data), Frame Check Sequence (CRC)

3. Filters Incoming Frames:
Incoming frames include a destination MAC. The interface checks if the frame is:
- Addressed to its own MAC
- A broadcast address (ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff)
- A relevant multicast address

If none of these match, the frame is ignored.

4. ARP Integration:
ARP maps an IP address to a MAC address within a local network segment (LAN). 
Devices typically know each other by IP (layer 3), but at layer 2 (Ethernet/Wi-Fi), they need the MAC.


- Step 1: Check the ARP Cache

Your computer first checks its ARP cache (a local table that stores IP-to-MAC mappings): 
If the MAC for 192.168.1.20 is found → use it immediately to send data. 
If not found → proceed to send an ARP Request. 

- Step 2: ARP Request (Broadcast):

If a device (say 192.168.1.10) wants to send data to 192.168.1.20 but doesn’t have the MAC address, it broadcasts an ARP Request: *“Who has `192.168.1.20`? Tell me your MAC!”*
This broadcast frame goes to `ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff`, reaching **all** nodes on the LAN.

- Step 3: ARP Reply (Unicast):

Only the device whose IP is `192.168.1.20` responds with an ARP Reply, which is a **unicast** frame back to 192.168.1.10: *“I am 192.168.1.20, and my MAC address is aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff.”*

- Step 4: ARP Cache Update:

The requesting device saves this IP-to-MAC mapping in its ARP cache. Next time it needs to send data to 192.168.1.20, it can directly use aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff as the destination MAC, bypassing another ARP request.

- Step 5: Timeouts and Refresh:

ARP cache entries eventually time out, ensuring updates if a device’s MAC changes or a different device acquires the same IP.



## Chinese Answer:
OSI模型， 是国际标准化组织（ISO）制定的一个用于计算机或通信系统间互联的标准体系，将计算机网络通信划分为七个不同的层级，每个层级都负责特定的功能。每个层级都构建在其下方的层级之上，并为上方的层级提供服务。七层从下到上分别是物理层、数据链路层、网络层、传输层、会话层、表示层和应用层。虽然OSI模型在理论上更全面，但在实际网络通信中，TCP/IP模型更为实用。 TCP/IP模型分为四个层级，每个层级负责特定的网络功能。 
1. 应用层：该层与OSI模型的应用层和表示层以及会话层类似，提供直接**与用户应用程序交互的接口**。它为网络上的各种应用程序提供服务，如电子邮件（SMTP）、网页浏览（HTTP）、文件传输（FTP）等。
2. 传输层：该层对应OSI模型的传输层。它负责端到端的数据传输，提供可靠的、无连接的数据传输服务。主要的传输层协议有TCP和UDP。TCP提供可靠的数据传输，确保数据的正确性和完整性；而UDP则是无连接的，适用于不要求可靠性的传输，如实时音频和视频流。
3. 网络层：该层对应OSI模型的网络层。主要协议是IP，它负责数据包的路由和转发，选择最佳路径将数据从源主机传输到目标主机。IP协议使用IP地址来标识主机和网络，并进行逻辑地址寻址。
4. 网络接口层：该层对应OSI模型的数据链路层和物理层。它负责物理传输媒介的传输，例如以太网、Wi-Fi等，并提供错误检测和纠正的功能。此外，网络接口层还包含硬件地址（MAC地址）的管理。
