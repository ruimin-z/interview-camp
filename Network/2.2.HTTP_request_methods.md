HTTP有哪些请求方式？

    GET：请求指定的资源。
    POST：向指定资源提交数据进行处理请求（例如表单提交）。
    PUT：更新指定资源。
    DELETE：删除指定资源。
    HEAD：获取报文首部，不返回报文主体。
    OPTIONS：查询服务器支持的请求方法。
    PATCH：对资源进行部分更新。




The **status line** contains both the HTTP version and a numeric and text representation of the status of the request. 

The browser considers a status code in the 200s to be successful. The response was 200, so the browser knows to render the response.
Resources can be static files, either text (i.e index.html) or non-text data (i.e. logo.img). 
Often, browsers request dynamic resources generated at the time of the request and there is no file associated with the resource. 
The server generates a dynamic resource, building the HTML from fragments or templates and combining it with dynamic data to send back in the response, as text, so the browser can render the page.


HTTP defines several request methods, each serving a different purpose:

    GET:
    Retrieves a specific resource. It’s a read-only operation and should not have side effects.
    Example: Fetching a web page or data from an API.

    POST:
    Submits data to a specified resource for processing, such as form submissions or creating new records.
    Example: Submitting a registration form.

    PUT:
    Updates an existing resource with new data. Usually replaces the entire resource.
    Example: Updating user profile information.

    DELETE:
    Deletes the specified resource.
    Example: Removing a user account.

    HEAD:
    Similar to GET, but only retrieves the headers — not the body. Used to check if a resource exists or to inspect metadata.
    Example: Checking if a file has changed without downloading it.

    OPTIONS:
    Returns the HTTP methods supported by the server for a specific URL. Often used in CORS preflight requests.
    Example: Browser asks the server: "Do you allow POST requests from this origin?"

    PATCH:
    Performs a partial update to a resource, modifying only the specified fields.
    Example: Updating just the email address in a user profile.
