# Process v.s. Thread

### Program, Process, and Thread
A _program_ is a **passive** set of instructions stored on disk.

A _process_ is an **active** instance of that program running in memory. Process is the smallest unit for program execution. 

_Thread_ is the smallest execution unit within the process.


> What is in a process? What is in a thread? **(needs further researching in OS)**
> 
> A process contains a code section, data section, heap, stack, program counter (PC), registers, memory space, and other resources.
> A thread contains its own PC, registers, and stack, but shares the code, heap, and global variables with other threads in the same process.


### Multithreading and Multiprocessing
When a program is running, it can create one or more processes, and each process can contain at least one threads.

Multiple threads within the same process can run concurrently, allowing for parallel task execution.
Multithreading aims to increase the utilization of a single CPU core.

Multiprocessing aims to achieve parallelism and increase the utilization of multiple CPU cores.



1. Memory Management:
  - Processes: (Isolation) Each process has its own isolated memory space. Memory is not shared between processes.
  - Threads: (Shared Memory) Threads within the same process share the same memory space. 
  Each thread can directly read and write to the same variable and data structures.

    
2. Creation/Termination/Context switching
  - Processes: (Heavyweight)
    - Creating a new process involves duplicating the parent process’s memory space, which is resource-intensive.
    - Termination involves releasing all the resources allocated to the process.
    - Context switching between processes is also more expensive because the operating system must save and restore the entire process state.
  - Threads: (Lightweight)
    - Thread creation and termination are easier and faster, since threads share the same memory and resources of the parent process.
    - Context switching between threads is more efficient, requiring only saving and restoring the thread’s registers and stack pointer.

3. Fault Tolerance/Stability
  - Processes: Due to isolation, one process status will not affect others.  However, this isolation makes communication more complex and slower.
  - Threads: Access the same memory space. One crashed thread could potentially bring down the entire process.

4. Communication
  - Processes communicate with each other using **inter-process communication (IPC)** mechanisms like pipes, sockets, message queues, or shared memory.
  - Threads communication is as easy as accessing the same memory. However, processes can use `Mutex互斥锁`, which is a type of lock that ensures only one process can access a critical section at a time,
    or `Semaphore信号量`,which controls access to shared resources by maintaining a counter, to limit usage on memory addresses to prevent race conditions and data corruption.

> `Mutex互斥锁` & `Semaphore信号量`

> Train example: Processes are trains, threads are cabins. 
> - (Mutex) Processes can lock memory addresses: train can lock the restroom when someone is in use.
> - (Semaphore) Processes can limit the usage of memory address: cafeteria only allow certain number of people to access.

## Chinese Version: 进程和线程之间有什么区别?

进程是资源分配和调度的基本单位。

线程是程序执行的最小单位，线程是进程的子任务，是进程内的执行单元。 一个进程至少有一个线程，一个进程可以运行多个线程，这些线程共享同一块内存。

资源开销：

    进程：由于每个进程都有独立的内存空间，创建和销毁进程的开销较大。进程间切换需要保存和恢复整个进程的状态，因此上下文切换的开销较高。
    线程：线程共享相同的内存空间，创建和销毁线程的开销较小。线程间切换只需要保存和恢复少量的线程上下文，因此上下文切换的开销较小。

通信与同步：

    进程：由于进程间相互隔离，进程之间的通信需要使用一些特殊机制，如管道、消息队列、共享内存等。
    线程：由于线程共享相同的内存空间，它们之间可以直接访问共享数据，线程间通信更加方便。

安全性：

    进程：由于进程间相互隔离，一个进程的崩溃不会直接影响其他进程的稳定性。
    线程：由于线程共享相同的内存空间，一个线程的错误可能会影响整个进程的稳定性。
